# SRAM-Design
In this project a 4x4 SRAM was designed using 6T bitcell and all the peripherals are also designed the working was checked using simulation .
To access the file you need to have Cadence Virtuoso Licence and upload this files in the folder where you run you tool.
The Column MUX which was made is done using Transmitting gate and functions biderectionally.
For Row Decoder Nand inverter gates are used .
A Differentiable Sense Amplifier was used as Sense Amplifier.
